Python Programming Overview

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features:
1. Readability: Uses indentation to define code blocks, making it easy to learn and read.
2. Large Standard Library: Comes with a "batteries included" philosophy, providing tools for many tasks.
3. Dynamic Typing: Variables do not need explicit type declarations.
4. Multi-paradigm: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Common Use Cases:
- Web Development (Django, Flask)
- Data Science and AI (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Automation and Scripting
- Software Testing

Basic Syntax Example:
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

Python 3 is the current version, with Python 2 being officially retired in 2020.
